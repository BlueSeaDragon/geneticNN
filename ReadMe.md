# Auto Neural Networks #
This projects aims to automate the design of neural networks architecture. 
This project is still at an early stage of development. A very simple prototype as already been implemented in the
[GenAlgv2 branch](https://github.com/BlueSeaDragon/geneticNN/tree/genAlgV2) though many functions are not there yet
( it is only compatible with fully connected layers and activation functions).

This branch aims at generalizing the prototype to any kind of layer and activation function (with reasonable constraints).
